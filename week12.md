The article begins by trying to define what a multilayer network is to standardize some of the different terminoligies used in different fields. Utilimitly the definition is fluid depending on the field. The researchers tested different multilayer network visualizations and grouped them on categories like, Cross-layer entity connectivity, Cross-layer entity comparison, Layer manipulation, reconfiguration, Layer comparison based on numerical attributes, Layer comparison based on topological, connectivity. One dimensional views looked at chord diagrams and parallel node-link bands like those made in graph trail for a starting point. 2d, 2.5D and 3D graphs utilize colors, depth, or differnt link designs to plot mutliple layers next to each other, but seperated by their layers. Can be helpful with small visualizations, but become overwhelming when displayed in large. Another interesting plot was the matrix based plots, using hybrid matrix node link plots you can reap the benfits of quick readability from node links as well as pros from the matrix visualizations. They are still doing research into defining a best practices, but recomend user testing for any plots, they think field and uses have grown greatly in past decade and will become more accessable.
