## Reflection

I wanted to start looking at differnt ways that are currently available to visualise dna alignment/ omics data which led me to this paper. This paper showcases many different tools and resources in R, Python and Java that could be used for ploting omics data. Main things I was looking for was ways to utilize omics data in chord diagrams. Because of the size of the data for genomics research many of the platforms are not web based. I would be interested in trying to find a way to make some of these plots with d3 as their components do not seem overely complex, but further research needs to be done. Either way this was a good insight into some of the available technologies regarding circular omics data portrayal.
