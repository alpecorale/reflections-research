## Reflection
Wanted to look at UpSet as an alternative to vendiagrams for visualizing how data is connected between sets. Design reminds me of some visualizations I have seen for time series data. Using a visualization like this may be helpful for showing set interactions between the different proteins and their relations to each group. Initial attempts to decode the relations are a little difficult, but with some training it is effective. It also takes up a lot less space than a vendiagram and shows it in a more succinct way.
