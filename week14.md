## Reflection
On creating our initial network visualization for our final project I noticed the browser was struggling a little to render and handle the large network visualization in d3. After doing a little research I found this paper on NetV.js which is a library that was built for high-efficiency visualizations of large-scale graphs and networks. The paper begins by addressing the gap in the field for an easy to use large-scale network visalizer, as others have been made but are typically more reserved for lower level languages lik c# or C++ because of their performance speed. To achieve the rendering speeds and performance they are looking for the researchers utilized the users GPU to render the networks. NetV.js had a few other goals with regards to usability, they built and support a large amount of interactivity as well as lasso selection of nodes. Ultimitly this JS library looks pretty interesting and easy enough to use that I may utilize it for my final project.
