## Reflection

While I initially started reading this paper to get a better of idea of how to use small multiple for genomics data sets I found the first half of the paper rather intersting as it was about the computer scientists working with the biologists to get an idea of what types of visualizations they wanted. In a few sessions of just talking to the scientists and them showing the developers what they were working with they had an idea of the type of application they wanted to create. One tool that they mentioned they used in the creation of their application was Node Trix, a hybrid representation of networks based on the node- link diagram where communities can be represented as matrices. Another cool tool that they mentioned getting inspiration from was MultiPiles which is a visualization to explore time-series of dense, weighted networks and is based on the physical analogy of piling adjacency matrices, each one representing a single temporal snapshot. Resulting product is a scatterplot of small multiples that use NodeTrix to link between each other and MultiPiles to summarise and group data at each point. The program seems pretty thorough in the sense that it has many options for filtering and different views for looking at data individually or grouped and seems to have made a significant impact in how these scientists do work.
